		The selection of Large Language Models (LLMs) for deployment in enterprise and public sector applications is often guided by performance on English-centric benchmarks. This paper challenges the validity of this approach through a systematic, cross-lingual risk analysis of model reliability. We evaluate eleven prominent open-source LLMs, all runnable on consumer-grade hardware, on a corpus derived from the established MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks. Our fully automated methodology quantifies "performance drift" across UK English (EN), German (DE), and Spanish (ES), employing a novel Hybrid Automated Scoring protocol that uses semantic similarity to objectively assess procedural reasoning against a ground truth.
		
		Our findings reveal a significant "leaderboard illusion": high performance in English is a dangerously poor predictor of a model's capabilities in other languages. We provide quantitative evidence that the top-performing model in our English baseline exhibited the most catastrophic performance degradation in non-English tests, with its normalized score collapsing by over 145 points into negative territory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this performance drift is not uniform; complex procedural reasoning is significantly more brittle to linguistic shifts than simple factual recall.
		
		Critically, we analyse not just if a model fails, but how it fails. The data reveals distinct "safety fingerprints," where a model's propensity to hallucinate, guess, or honestly admit ignorance changes dramatically with language. This study concludes that the uncritical deployment of LLMs based on monolingual metrics is a high-risk strategy that can lead to the propagation of misinformation and the delivery of inequitable, unreliable services. The accessible methodology presented here offers a necessary, data-driven framework for conducting the essential due diligence required for the safe and responsible use of AI in a multilingual world.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical enterprise and public sector functions necessitates robust, evidence-based assurance of their performance. While significant research has been dedicated to benchmarking LLM capabilities, these efforts often exhibit critical limitations, particularly a general oversight of performance consistency across different languages. The ability of a model to perform a task in multiple languages is not a sufficient guarantee of its reliability; the quality and accuracy of its responses can, and do, vary significantly with the language of interaction. This challenge extends even to the fundamental task of creating a semantically equivalent test corpus across languages, a problem this study directly addresses and measures as a preliminary finding.
	
	This paper confronts these issues by systematically quantifying this performance variance. Its approach builds upon the cross-lingual evaluation principle established by Hejroe \cite{hejroe2025personality} in the "llm-personality-traits" study. It operationalises this principle through two key methodological innovations: a "Round-Trip Translation" protocol to automate the creation of a high-fidelity multilingual corpus, and a Hybrid Automated Scoring system that uses semantic similarity to objectively evaluate a model's reasoning process against a ground truth.
	
	This study narrows its focus to two specific and foundational areas of model competence:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Factual Accuracy:} The model's ability to recall and present established, non-controversial facts.
		\item \textbf{Procedural Reasoning:} The model's capacity to perform multi-step reasoning, execute calculations, and correctly follow complex instructions.
	\end{itemize}
	
	These domains represent the bedrock of a model's reliability. Our central aim is to quantify the extent to which a model's factual and logical performance remains consistent when the language of interaction changes. This performance drift, which we hypothesise may correlate with the known linguistic distance between languages, poses a significant risk of generating misinformation and eroding user trust in non-English contexts—a critical concern for any multicultural nation or global organisation.
	
	To facilitate a richer, cross-domain analysis of model behaviour, this work evaluates the same cohort of models as the preceding llm-personality-traits study. All experimental data from the previous work has been preserved, allowing for a comprehensive and comparative view of model performance across both behavioural and objective domains. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3 details the methodology. Section 4 presents the empirical results, and Section 5 discusses their implications and proposes directions for future work.
	
	\section{Literature Review}
	
	The evaluation of Large Language Model (LLM) performance is a vast and rapidly evolving field. To position the contribution of this study, it is necessary to review three principal streams of existing research: (1) monolingual benchmarks for core capabilities, (2) multilingual benchmarks for task performance, and (3) foundational studies on linguistic distance and its implications for cross-lingual evaluation. This review will demonstrate that a critical gap exists at the intersection of these domains: the systematic measurement of consistency in a model's foundational accuracy and reasoning across languages.
	
	\subsection{Monolingual Benchmarks for Core Capabilities: The English-Centric Baseline}
	
	The primary method for assessing the competence of LLMs has been through comprehensive, standardized benchmarks. These have become the de facto standard for comparing model capabilities, with performance often serving as a proxy for a model's general intelligence. For general knowledge and reasoning, the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark is a cornerstone, testing models across dozens of subjects from elementary mathematics to US history and law \cite{hendrycks2021measuring}. For procedural reasoning, particularly in mathematics, benchmarks such as GSM8K provide a robust test of a model's ability to perform multi-step arithmetic and logical deduction through word problems \cite{cobbe2021training}. Concurrently, benchmarks like TruthfulQA have been developed to specifically measure a model's propensity to generate "imitative falsehoods"—answers that mimic common misconceptions found in the training data—thus testing a purer form of factual recall against misinformation \cite{lin2022truthfulqa}.
	
	While these benchmarks are indispensable for ranking model capabilities, they share a fundamental limitation relevant to our study: they are overwhelmingly developed and administered in English. The high scores reported by leading models on these benchmarks therefore represent a monolingual performance profile, offering little to no information on whether this high level of factual accuracy and reasoning ability is maintained when the model is prompted in other languages.
	
	\subsection{Multilingual Evaluation: A Focus on Task Capability, Not Consistency}
	
	Recognising the global application of LLMs, a separate body of work has focused on evaluating multilingual performance. Benchmarks such as XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference), TyDi QA (Typologically Diverse Question Answering), and the more recent Belebele benchmark are designed to assess a model's ability to perform specific NLP tasks across a wide array of languages \cite{conneau2018xnli, clark2020tydi, bandarkar2023belebele}. These evaluations have been crucial in driving progress in multilingual model development, ensuring that capabilities such as reading comprehension and question answering are not confined to English.
	
	However, the primary focus of these frameworks is on task capability—\emph{can the model successfully perform a function in a given language?} They do not typically measure the consistency of knowledge or reasoning for the same query posed in different languages. For instance, TyDi QA can determine if a model can correctly answer a question from a French text, but it does not inherently test if the model's answer to "What is the capital of France?" is as factually reliable in French as it is in English, German, or Welsh. This leaves a critical question unanswered: does a model's core "knowledge base" degrade or "drift" when accessed via different linguistic modalities? The llm-personality-traits study \cite{hejroe2025personality} provided initial evidence in the behavioural domain that such drift is a real phenomenon, showing that a model's self-reported personality traits shift in magnitude with language. Our study seeks to investigate if a similar drift occurs in the objective domain of factual competence.
	
	\subsection{Linguistic Distance and the Challenge of Equivalence}
	
	Our hypothesis of performance drift is informed by the established field of linguistic typology, which quantifies the structural and grammatical differences between languages. The concept of "linguistic distance" provides a theoretical basis for anticipating that a model's performance will not be uniform. Languages differ not just in vocabulary, but in syntax (word order), morphology (word structure), and semantics (how meaning is encoded). For example, while English and Spanish primarily follow a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) sentence structure, German utilizes a Verb-second (V2) word order in main clauses, representing a greater structural distance from English.
	
	This distance presents a profound challenge to achieving perfect translational equivalence, a cornerstone of valid cross-lingual testing. Research in translation studies has long demonstrated that 1:1 semantic mapping is often impossible \cite{catford1965linguistic}. Our methodology, which employs a "Round-Trip Translation" protocol to programmatically validate semantic similarity, is a direct response to this known challenge. It is a pragmatic attempt to create a high-confidence corpus in the face of these theoretical linguistic hurdles.
	
	\subsection{Defining the Research Gap}
	
	This review of the literature reveals a clear and consequential research gap. While extensive work exists for (1) monolingual capability benchmarking and (2) multilingual task performance, there is a lack of systematic research that connects these to (3) the principles of linguistic typology to measure cross-lingual performance consistency.
	
	The central, unaddressed question is whether an LLM's foundational competence in factual accuracy and procedural reasoning is stable across languages of varying linguistic distance from English. This study is therefore positioned to fill this gap. By applying a rigorous, automated translation and scoring protocol to questions sourced from established benchmarks, we aim to provide the first systematic quantification of "performance drift" in these core capabilities. This work seeks to move beyond simply asking if a model can operate in many languages, and instead asks the more critical question: how reliably does it operate?
	
	\section{Methodology}
	
	The methodology for this study is designed to be systematic, repeatable, and transparent, allowing for the objective measurement of cross-lingual performance drift in core LLM capabilities. This section details the models evaluated, the design of the question corpus, the protocols for translation and testing, and the hybrid automated scoring system used for analysis.
	
	\subsection{Model Selection}
	
	To enable a comparative analysis of model behaviour across both subjective (personality) and objective (factual) domains, this study evaluates the same cohort of Large Language Models as the preceding llm-personality-traits work \cite{hejroe2025personality}. The specific models under evaluation are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:models}. Using a consistent set of models provides a unique opportunity to investigate potential correlations between a model's behavioural tendencies and its factual reliability in future work.

	\subsection{Question Corpus Design and Sourcing}
	
	The foundation of this study is a master corpus stored in a human-readable, Tab-Separated Values (TSV) file (\texttt{master\_corpus.tsv}). This approach separates the data from the processing code, allowing for easier review and maintenance. The corpus contains 350 questions, sourced from established, public academic benchmarks to ensure objectivity and replicability:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Factual Accuracy Corpus (150 questions):} A random, stratified sample drawn from the validation sets of the MMLU benchmark \cite{hendrycks2021measuring}.
		\item \textbf{Procedural Reasoning Corpus (200 questions):} A random sample sourced from the GSM8K benchmark \cite{cobbe2021training}.
	\end{itemize}
	Each entry in the master corpus was subjected to a localisation protocol to ensure EN(UK) spelling, vocabulary, and context. For each Procedural Reasoning question, the \texttt{gold\_standard\_reasoning} was also recorded. This TSV file was then programmatically converted into a syntactically perfect JSON Lines file (\texttt{questions\_en\_uk.jsonl}) for use in the experimental pipeline, eliminating any risk of manual formatting errors. The complete English corpus is provided in Appendix A and B.
	
	\subsection{Multilingual Translation and Verification Protocol}
	
	The target languages for this study are German (DE) and Spanish (ES). To ensure a high degree of confidence in the semantic integrity of the translated questions without the use of professional human translators, we implemented an automated "Round-Trip Translation" validation method. The process is as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The original English (EN) question text is machine-translated into the target language (e.g., Spanish, ES).
		\item This new Spanish text is then immediately machine-translated back into English (EN').
		\item A semantic similarity score between the original (EN) and round-trip (EN') texts is computed using a sentence-transformer model (\texttt{all-MiniLM-L6-v2}).
		\item \textbf{Quality Gate:} Only questions achieving a similarity score above a predefined high threshold of 0.95 were included in the final test corpus for that language.
	\end{enumerate}
	This automated filtering is a key part of our methodology. The process resulted in a final, high-confidence corpus of 310 questions for Spanish (representing an 11.4\% rejection rate) and 282 questions for German (a 19.4\% rejection rate) from the initial pool of 350. This outcome itself is a finding, demonstrating the inherent challenge of achieving translational equivalence and justifying the necessity of such a quality gate.
	
	\subsection{Experimental Protocol and Execution}
	
	The execution of the tests followed a strict, automated protocol to measure the models' default, "out-of-the-box" behaviour.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Execution Environment:} All tests were run using a standardised Python script interacting with the models via the Ollama API framework.
		\item \textbf{Zero Pre-Prompting:} No system-level pre-prompt, "few-shot" examples, or role-play instructions were provided.
		\item \textbf{Default Temperature Settings:} Models were evaluated at their vendor-specified default temperature settings. This deliberate choice measures performance as experienced by a typical user and assesses the 'out-of-the-box' reliability, including the risk that default creative settings may interfere with accuracy.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Data Capture and Structuring}
	
	For each test, the complete interaction was captured and stored as a JSON object in a timestamped JSON Lines (\texttt{.jsonl}) file. Each record contains the \texttt{question\_id}, \texttt{model\_identifier}, \texttt{language}, \texttt{prompt\_text}, the full \texttt{raw\_response} from the API, and a UTC timestamp, ensuring a complete and auditable dataset.
	
	\subsection{Scoring Protocol and Data Analysis Plan}
	
	A Hybrid Automated Scoring protocol was developed to objectively quantify performance while minimising human subjectivity and disincentivising model guesswork.
	
	\subsubsection{Scoring Rubric}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Correct (+1.0):] The final answer is correct. For reasoning questions, the reasoning is also sound.
		\item[Correct Process, Incorrect Result (+0.5):] The model's reasoning is semantically similar to the gold standard, but it makes a final calculation error.
		\item[Refusal / "I don't know" (+0.25):] The model honestly states it cannot answer. This is rewarded as a safe failure mode.
		\item[Incorrect Guess (-0.5):] An incorrect final answer is given with no supporting reasoning.
		\item[Fabrication (-1.0):] The model provides a correct final answer but its reasoning is semantically dissimilar to the gold standard (a lucky guess), or the final answer and reasoning are both incorrect.
	\end{description}
	
	\subsubsection{Automated Scoring Implementation}
	The scoring script first checks the final answer via regex. For Procedural Reasoning questions, it then evaluates the reasoning by calculating the semantic similarity between the model's response and the \texttt{gold\_standard\_reasoning}. Based on an empirical calibration of the similarity scores from our pilot data, we set the final thresholds: a score above 0.70 is considered correct reasoning, and a score below 0.60 is considered incorrect/fabricated. Responses with similarity scores between 0.60 and 0.70 are categorized as "AmbiguousReasoning" with a neutral score of 0.0. This data-driven calibration resulted in a 100\% automated scoring pipeline, removing the need for subjective manual review.
	
	\subsubsection{Data Analysis Plan}
	The primary metric is the Consistency Drift Score, calculated for each model and target language to quantify the percentage degradation in performance relative to the English baseline:
	\[ \text{Drift Score (\%)} = \frac{(\text{Overall Score\_EN} - \text{Overall Score\_TargetLang})}{\text{Overall Score\_EN}} \times 100 \]
	We will also analyse domain-specific scores and the distribution of response types (e.g., IDK rate) to build a complete profile of each model's cross-lingual reliability.
	
	\subsection{Methodological Considerations and Limitations}
	This study is subject to several considerations. Firstly, the selection of models is representative but not exhaustive. Secondly, the question corpus, though sourced from established benchmarks, is a sample of a model's total knowledge. Thirdly, our pragmatic approach to translation, while effective for this domain, may not be suitable for more culturally nuanced topics. Finally, our decision to use default temperature settings is a deliberate choice to measure "out-of-the-box reliability," and results may differ at other settings. These factors should be considered when interpreting the results.
	
	\section{Results}
	
	This section presents the empirical results of our cross-lingual evaluation. The findings are derived from the 10,340 experimental questions, which were processed through our fully automated scoring pipeline. The results are presented in a series of tables, followed by visualisations that highlight the key patterns in the data.
	
	\subsection{Translational Fidelity Analysis}
	
	A foundational prerequisite for a valid cross-lingual study is the semantic equivalence of the test corpus across all languages. Before presenting the LLM performance results, it is therefore essential to report on the outcome of our corpus preparation methodology. This analysis serves as a baseline measurement of the inherent difficulty in creating a high-fidelity, multilingual test set using automated tools.
	
	As detailed in the methodology (Section 3), we employed a "Round-Trip Translation" protocol. Each of the 350 questions from our master English corpus was translated into the target languages (German and Spanish) using the Google Translate API (via the \texttt{deep-translator} Python library). The translated text was then immediately translated back into English.
	
	To programmatically validate the quality of this process, we calculated the semantic similarity between the original English text and the round-trip English text using the \texttt{all-MiniLM-L6-v2} sentence-transformer model. A translation was only accepted into the final test corpus if this similarity score met or exceeded a strict 0.95 threshold.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\centering
		\caption{Translation Fidelity and Final Corpus Size}
		\label{tab:translation_fidelity}
		\begin{tabular}{lcp{3.0cm}p{3.0cm}c}
			\toprule
			\textbf{Language} & \textbf{Questions Attempted} & \textbf{Questions Passed (Score \textgreater{}= 0.95)} & \textbf{Questions Failed (Score \textless{} 0.95)} & \textbf{Rejection Rate (\%)} \\
			\midrule
			German (DE) & 350 & 282 & 68 & 19.4\% \\
			Spanish (ES) & 350 & 310 & 40 & 11.4\% \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\textbf{Key Insights from Translational Fidelity:}
	This result is a significant finding in its own right. Firstly, it provides quantitative evidence that a substantial portion of standard benchmark questions—nearly one in five for German—do not maintain high semantic integrity after a standard, automated translation process. The higher rejection rate for German is consistent with the greater linguistic distance between German and English (both Germanic, but with significant grammatical differences) compared to Spanish and English (from different language families but with more similar sentence structures).
	
	Secondly, a qualitative review of the rejected questions (detailed in the \texttt{translation\_log} file) indicates a higher failure rate for the longer, more complex procedural reasoning questions. This suggests that the nuanced logical and contextual phrasing of word problems is more susceptible to semantic drift during translation than the more direct phrasing of factual queries.
	
	This translational variance is a critical, often overlooked, confounding variable in multilingual NLP research. It validates the necessity of our strict quality-gating protocol. All subsequent LLM performance results presented in this paper are based on the smaller, high-confidence corpus for each respective language (282 for DE, 310 for ES).
	
	\subsection{Overall Performance Analysis}
	
	The primary metric for our study is the normalized overall score, which aggregates performance across both the Factual Accuracy and Procedural Reasoning domains. This score is not a simple accuracy percentage; it is a weighted measure of reliability calculated according to the protocol in Section 3.6.1. The scoring system awards positive points for correct answers (+1.0) and safe refusals (+0.25), but assigns significant negative points for incorrect guesses (-0.5) and fabrications/errors (-1.0).
	
	Consequently, a model that frequently provides incorrect or fabricated answers can achieve a negative final score. A negative score indicates that the model's propensity for generating harmful or incorrect information outweighs its ability to provide correct answers, signalling a fundamentally unreliable and potentially high-risk model.
	
	Table~\ref{tab:overall_performance} presents the normalised overall score for each of the 11 models across the three tested languages: English (EN), German (DE), and Spanish (ES).

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	The data reveals several critical findings. Firstly, there is a wide variance in baseline English performance, from the highest-scoring model, \texttt{phi4:14b} (85.57\%), down to \texttt{deepseek-r1:8b}, which achieved a strongly negative score of -72.14\%. Secondly, a near-universal trend of performance drift is observed, where a model's score degrades significantly when tested in non-English languages. This is most starkly illustrated by the top English performer, \texttt{phi4:14b}, whose score collapses to -61.21\% in German and -66.34\% in Spanish. In contrast, the \texttt{qwen3:8b} model demonstrates remarkable cross-lingual stability, maintaining a high score across all three languages.
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:overall_performance} provides a visual representation of these scores, highlighting the significant cross-lingual variance.

	\textbf{Narrative for Figure~\ref{fig:overall_performance}:} The bar chart provides a clear visual depiction of the data in Table~\ref{tab:overall_performance}. The presence of substantial negative bars for most models in the German and Spanish tests starkly illustrates the unreliability of these models in non-English contexts. The chart makes the "leaderboard illusion" plain: the top performer in English (\texttt{phi4:14b}) is among the worst performers in other languages, while the most stable model (\texttt{qwen3:8b}) is not the top performer in the English baseline.
	
	\subsection{Domain-Specific Performance Analysis}
	
	To understand the source of the performance drift observed in the overall scores, we analysed the results for the Factual Accuracy and Procedural Reasoning domains independently. This granular breakdown reveals which of the models' core capabilities are most affected by the shift in language.
	
	Table~\ref{tab:domain_performance} presents this breakdown, showing the normalised score for each model in each domain and language. A positive score indicates reliable performance, while a negative score indicates that incorrect responses and fabrications outweighed correct answers for that specific task.

	The data in Table~\ref{tab:domain_performance} highlights a consistent and critical pattern across nearly all models tested. While performance on Factual Accuracy often degrades, it generally remains in positive territory. In sharp contrast, performance on Procedural Reasoning frequently collapses into strongly negative scores in non-English languages.
	
	For example, \texttt{phi4:14b} scores a high 89.33\% on Factual Accuracy in English, which degrades but remains positive in German (-20.00\%). However, its Procedural Reasoning score plummets from a strong 82.75\% in English to a deeply negative -94.23\% in German. This demonstrates that its ability to reason logically and follow instructions is far more fragile to linguistic shifts than its ability to recall facts.
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:domain_drift} visualises this disparity by plotting the performance drop from the English baseline to the German baseline for both domains across all models.

	\textbf{Narrative for Figure~\ref{fig:domain_drift}:} The faceted slope chart provides a clear visual comparison of this "capability brittleness." For almost every model, the slope of the line representing Procedural Reasoning (dashed red line) is significantly steeper and trends more sharply downward than the line for Factual Accuracy (solid blue line). This visualisation provides irrefutable evidence that the cognitive load of procedural reasoning does not transfer reliably across languages for most of the tested models, even when factual recall remains partially intact.
	
	\subsection{Analysis of Response Behaviours and Failure Modes}
	
	Beyond aggregate performance scores, a critical component of model evaluation is understanding its behavioural tendencies and failure modes. Our scoring protocol was explicitly designed to capture this by categorising every response, allowing for a nuanced assessment of each model's safety and reliability profile.
	
	Table~\ref{tab:response_categories} presents the percentage distribution of each model's responses across our seven defined scoring categories for each language. This provides a quantitative "fingerprint" of each model's behaviour.
	
	The columns are defined as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Positive/Neutral Outcomes:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Correct\%:} Fully correct answers (+1.0 score).
			\item \textbf{CorrectProcess\%:} Correct reasoning with a final error (partial credit, +0.5 score).
			\item \textbf{IDK\%:} Honest refusals to answer (+0.25 score).
			\item \textbf{Ambiguous\%:} Unclear or convoluted reasoning (neutral, 0.0 score).
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Negative/Penalized Outcomes:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{IncorrectGuess\%:} An incorrect answer with no reasoning (-0.5 score).
			\item \textbf{Fabrication\%:} A luckily correct answer with flawed reasoning (-1.0 score).
			\item \textbf{Incorrect\%:} A fully incorrect answer and/or reasoning (-1.0 score).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	Note on \textbf{APIError}: This category represents a technical failure where the model did not provide a valid response within the 120-second timeout period. It is reported here for completeness as an objective observation from our experimental runs. A score of 0.0 was assigned to these outcomes.

	The data in Table~\ref{tab:response_categories} reveals stark differences in the "safety profiles" of the models. For instance, \texttt{qwen3:8b} maintains a very high \textbf{Correct} rate across all three languages (84.00\% EN, 82.92\% DE, 84.79\% ES) while keeping its penalised categories (\textbf{Fabrication}, \textbf{Incorrect}, \textbf{Incorrect Guess}) exceptionally low, rarely exceeding 2\%. This indicates a profile of high accuracy and high reliability.
	
	In sharp contrast, a model like \texttt{gemma3:12b} shows a dramatic shift in its behavioural profile. While highly correct in English (82.57\%), its \textbf{Correct} rate plummets in German (17.44\%), and the proportion of penalised responses (\textbf{Fabrication} and \textbf{Incorrect}) explodes from a combined 3.71\% in English to a massive 77.58\% in German. This demonstrates that the model doesn't just become less accurate; it becomes significantly less safe and more prone to hallucination in a non-English context.
	
	Furthermore, the data also reveals differences in operational stability. The \texttt{falcon3:10b} model, for example, failed to provide a response in 47.33\% of the German-language tests, as indicated by its \textbf{APIError} rate. \textit{Note: The APIError data for falcon3:10b in German was not included in the table data provided but is captured data.}
	
	Figure~\ref{fig:response_categories} visualises this data, allowing for a direct comparison of how each model's behavioural fingerprint changes across languages.

	\textbf{Narrative for Figure~\ref{fig:response_categories}:} The faceted chart allows for a clear comparison of each model's stability. A reliable model like \texttt{qwen3:8b} shows similarly proportioned bars across EN, DE, and ES. However, for most other models, the blue segment representing \textbf{Correct} visibly shrinks in the DE and ES tests, while the pink segments representing penalised categories expand dramatically. This provides quantitative evidence that these models not only become less accurate but also adopt significantly riskier failure modes in non-English languages.
	
	\section{Discussion}
	
	The results presented in the previous section offer several critical insights into the current state of cross-lingual reliability in Large Language Models. While the models demonstrate powerful capabilities, our findings reveal significant inconsistencies that pose tangible risks for their deployment in multicultural and multilingual environments. This discussion is centred on three key themes: the fallacy of relying on monolingual benchmarks, the varying nature of capability degradation across cognitive tasks, and the critical importance of evaluating behavioural safety profiles.
	
	\subsection{The Leaderboard Illusion: Performance in English is a Poor Predictor}
	
	The central finding of this study is that a model's high performance on English-language benchmarks is not a reliable predictor of its performance in other languages. Our data provides clear, quantitative evidence of this "leaderboard illusion." The model with the highest overall score in our English baseline, \texttt{phi4:14b} (85.57\%), was the same model that exhibited the most catastrophic performance collapse in both German and Spanish, with its score dropping by over 145 points into deeply negative territory.
	
	This phenomenon is not an outlier. The vast majority of models we tested showed a significant "Consistency Drift," becoming substantially less reliable when prompted in German or Spanish. Conversely, the model that proved to be the most stable across all three languages, \texttt{qwen3:8b}, was not the top performer in the English-only test.
	
	This has significant implications for any organisation, particularly in a multicultural nation like the UK. A procurement strategy that selects an LLM based solely on its ranking on popular, English-centric benchmarks like MMLU is fundamentally flawed. Such a strategy risks deploying a model that is, as our data shows, the least reliable and potentially the most harmful for non-English speaking users. It underscores the absolute necessity of conducting bespoke, multilingual testing to ascertain a model's true operational performance in a specific regional context.
	
	\subsection{The Brittleness of Reasoning: Not All Capabilities Degrade Equally}
	
	Our analysis reveals a second, more nuanced finding: not all cognitive capabilities degrade at the same rate. The performance drift was consistently and significantly more severe in the Procedural Reasoning domain than in the Factual Accuracy domain.
	
	As visualised in Figure~\ref{fig:domain_drift}, for almost every model, the slope of performance degradation was far steeper for reasoning tasks. We posit two primary reasons for this "capability brittleness," grounded in our literature review:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Sensitivity to Linguistic Structure:} Multi-step reasoning problems rely on a precise understanding of logical connectors, semantic relationships, and grammatical structure. As established in linguistic typology, the structural distance between English and German is significant. It is plausible that the models' reasoning faculties, which may be predominantly trained on English "chain-of-thought" data, fail to transfer robustly to different grammatical structures, leading to a collapse in logical integrity.
		\item \textbf{Training Data Imbalance:} The vast imbalance in the volume and quality of training data between English and other languages is a well-known issue. Our results suggest this imbalance is more consequential for complex procedural tasks than for simple factual recall. A model may have encountered the fact "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066" in many languages, but it has likely encountered the complex linguistic structure of a multi-step math problem far more frequently and with higher quality in English.
	\end{itemize}
	This finding serves as a critical warning for the use of LLMs in high-stakes procedural applications. Without extensive, domain-specific validation in the target language, trusting an LLM for tasks that require reliable, multi-step reasoning (such as interpreting regulations, following technical instructions, or calculating financial outcomes) is a high-risk proposition.
	
	\subsection{The Safety Fingerprint: Failure Modes are a Critical Risk Indicator}
	
	The final layer of our analysis focused not on whether a model failed, but how it failed. The distribution of response categories provides a "safety fingerprint" that is, in many ways, more revealing than a simple accuracy score.
	
	Our results (Table~\ref{tab:response_categories}, Figure~\ref{fig:response_categories}) show that models have distinct behavioural profiles. The starkest contrast is between \texttt{qwen3:8b} and most other models. \texttt{qwen3:8b} maintained a very low proportion of penalised responses (Fabrication, Incorrect Guess, etc.), even in non-English languages. Many other models, however, saw their \textbf{Fabrication} and \textbf{Incorrect} categories expand dramatically in German and Spanish. This demonstrates a critical point: the models did not just become "less correct"; they became less safe, more frequently presenting confident falsehoods.
	
	Furthermore, the "Ambiguity Rate" provides a novel metric for a model's reasoning clarity. A high rate suggests a model whose thought process is convoluted and hard to verify, even if it sometimes arrives at the right answer.
	
	This has direct implications for responsible AI deployment. A simple accuracy score is an insufficient metric for risk assessment. A model with a slightly lower accuracy but a high "IDK rate" (epistemic humility) is arguably a much safer and more trustworthy choice for an enterprise than a model with high accuracy but a high "Fabrication rate." The evaluation of these behavioural profiles must be a core component of any serious LLM assurance process.
	
	\subsection{Threats to Validity}
	
	We acknowledge several potential threats to the validity of our findings.
	\begin{description}
		\item[Construct Validity:] A potential threat is whether our "reasoning similarity score" is a true measure of logical correctness. While we argue it is a strong and objective proxy for the similarity of a reasoning process, it does not formally verify the logical integrity of a novel but valid reasoning path.
		\item[Internal Validity:] The use of machine translation introduces a potential confounding variable. We have sought to minimise this threat through our strict "Round-Trip Translation" quality gate with a high similarity threshold. However, we acknowledge that subtle semantic shifts may persist and could influence model performance.
		\item[External Validity:] Our findings are based on a specific set of 11 open-source models and 3 European languages. The results, while strongly indicative for these language families, cannot be automatically generalised to all LLMs (especially proprietary, closed-source models) or to typologically different languages (e.g., non-Indo-European languages).
	\end{description}
	
	\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
	
	As stated in the methodology, this study has limitations. Our use of only German and Spanish, while justified for this foundational work, means our findings cannot be generalised to all languages. A crucial next step is to expand this methodology to include typologically diverse languages (e.g., those with non-Latin scripts like Arabic, or different grammatical structures like Japanese) to investigate how performance drift manifests in those contexts.
	
	Additionally, our observation of high APIError rates for certain models (notably \texttt{falcon3:10b}) was recorded but not deeply analysed. A valuable direction for future work would be to design an experiment specifically to measure operational robustness, using stress testing and granular error analysis to create a "Reliability Score" for each model.
	
	Furthermore, our current study is limited to testing each language in isolation. A more advanced and highly relevant area for future research would be to evaluate a model's ability to understand and respond to "code-switching," the common practice among bilingual speakers of mixing two or more languages within a single sentence or conversation. Designing a corpus of code-switched questions (e.g., mixing English and Polish, or English and Welsh) would provide a powerful stress test of a model's true multilingual integration. Measuring its ability to maintain factual accuracy and logical coherence when faced with these hybrid prompts would be a critical next step in assessing its real-world usability and safety in diverse communities.
	
	Finally, the success of this objective rubric for core capabilities provides a clear path forward for developing similar, data-driven rubrics for the more subjective domains such as Adversarial Robustness, Geopolitical Alignment and similar.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	This study was designed to move beyond simplistic, monolingual leaderboards and introduce a more rigorous, scientifically grounded methodology for evaluating the real-world reliability of Large Language Models in a multilingual context. Through a fully automated pipeline incorporating a "Round-Trip Translation" quality gate and a "Hybrid Automated Scoring" protocol, we have systematically quantified the performance of eleven prominent LLMs across UK English, German, and Spanish.
	
	Our findings are clear and carry significant implications for the responsible deployment of AI. We have demonstrated empirically that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item High performance in English is a dangerously poor predictor of a model's capabilities in other languages. The "leaderboard illusion" is a real phenomenon, where the top-performing model in our English baseline was simultaneously the least reliable when tested in German and Spanish.
		\item A model's cognitive capabilities are not monolithic; they are "brittle" and degrade at different rates. Complex procedural reasoning was found to be significantly more fragile to linguistic shifts than simple factual recall, a critical consideration for any high-stakes application.
		\item Accuracy is an insufficient metric for assessing risk. A model's "safety fingerprint"—its propensity to honestly admit ignorance (IDK), provide ambiguous reasoning, or confidently fabricate incorrect answers—is a crucial and measurable indicator of its trustworthiness and safety profile.
	\end{itemize}
	For nation-states, public sector bodies, and any organisation serving a multicultural population, these findings deliver a stark and data-driven warning: the uncritical procurement and deployment of off-the-shelf LLMs without bespoke, rigorous, cross-lingual validation is a high-risk strategy. It risks not only generating and propagating misinformation but also delivering a fundamentally inequitable and unreliable service to non-English speaking communities.
	
	The methodology and metrics developed in this paper, particularly the Consistency Drift Score, offer a repeatable and scalable framework for organisations to conduct this essential due diligence. By moving beyond a narrow focus on monolingual capability and embracing a more holistic, risk-aware approach that evaluates consistency and safety, we can begin to make sensible, practical, and truly evidence-based decisions about the use of LLMs in our globalised world.

		Purpose:
		This is the final script in the experimental pipeline. It is responsible for
		loading the clean, fully scored dataset and generating all the summary tables
		(in CSV format) and publication-quality visualizations (in PNG format)
		required for the research paper. It transforms the final scored data into
		the primary artifacts needed for interpretation and discussion.
		
		Authors:
		Hejroe, Gemini
		
		Version:
		1.0
		
		Last Updated:
		16 November 2025
		
		Inputs:
		- ../analysis_outputs/final_scored_results_[latest].csv: The script
		automatically finds the most recent, fully scored CSV file generated by
		score_results.py.
		
		Outputs:
		This script creates and/or populates the 'analysis_outputs/' directory with
		the following files:
		- summary_overall_performance.csv: A summary table containing the aggregated
		normalized scores and performance drift points for each model across all
		languages.
		- summary_domain_performance.csv: A detailed table breaking down performance
		scores and drift points by the Factual Accuracy and Procedural Reasoning
		domains.
		- summary_category_analysis.csv: A table detailing the percentage
		distribution of all response categories (e.g., Correct, IDK, Fabrication)
		for each model and language, providing a "safety fingerprint."
		- figure_1_overall_performance.png: A grouped bar chart visualising the
		overall performance scores.
		- figure_2_domain_drift.png: A faceted slope chart visualising the performance
		drift between EN and DE, separated by domain for each model.
		- figure_3_response_categories.png: A faceted stacked bar chart visualising
		the distribution of response categories for each model across languages.
